      <h1>Here is what we are going to do</h1>
      <p>
        We are researchers collecting data for a study... 
        lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum
      </p>
      <p>Here is what <strong>we will not do:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>We will not collect any payment information</li>
          <li>We will not collect any personally identifying info (PII) such as your name or address</li>
          <li>We will not save any data without your full consent! We will show you everything we want to save and ask you for your consent.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>If this is okay, here is how this works:
        <ul>
          <li>You click the "ready" button below</li>
          <li>You browser opens a tab with Amazon order histories</li>
          <li>If you are not logged into Amazon, you are prompted to log in. Please log in.</li>
          <li>You are asked survey questions in this window</li>
          <li>Your Amazon orders are scraped in the background.</li> 
          <!-- say it again  -->
          <li>We will not collect any personally identifying info (PII) such as your name or address.</li>
          <li>We show you all of the information collected.</li>
          <li>We ask for your consent to save it. You can decline.</li>
          <li>You click to submit or decline.</li>
        </ul>
        If you decline, none of your data will be saved! Only Amazon will have it ;-)
        No matter what you choose, thank you for your time!
