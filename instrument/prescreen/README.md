# Prescreen survey instrument

There was a prescreen survey. Participants who "passed" the prescreen were invited to participate in the main survey.

Participants "passed" the prescreen if they:

- Have had an Amazon account since 2018 or earlier
- Passed the attention check(s)
- Verify they can log into their Amazon account during the study 
- (Later version) Indicate they want to participate in the main survey after being told it asks them to log into their account.


See `prescreen-survey-instrument.pdf` for a non-interactive copy of the survey questions.

We verified with Prolific that the prescreen and its use of attention checks adhered to their guidelines.

There were multiple versions of the prescreen. And some versions were run within different batches on the survey platforms used.

The final version of the Prolific prescreen was then copied to a version to use on CloudResearch.
We used CloudResearch after it seemed we were exhausting the sample pool on Prolific.
There are two platforms within CloudResearch. One is built ontop of Amazom MTurk, "mturk toolkit". The other is called "connect".
We used both platforms. 
Surveys taken via connect have an additional parameter "connect" that is inserted as embedded data in the survey results.
They used the same cloudresearch version of the prescreen.
We initially tested on both connect and mturk toolkit. Then used mturk toolkit. But they mturk billing broke and we couldn't complete more surveys there and moved to connect.
