This will involve you signing into your Amazon account to download data.           	We WILL NOT collect any payment related information  	We WILL NOT collect personally identifying info (PII such as your name or address) -- this data will be stripped out 	We WILL NOT save any Amazon data without your consent     We will show you the purchases data we want to save and ask you for your consent to save it.
