# Amazon data and consumer privacy study

MIT IRB protocol # 2205000649


We crowdsourced years of Amazon purchases data from thousands of US consumers using a privacy-preserving and consent driven framework. 
To better inform and support future crowdsourcing efforts, we embedded an experiment in the data collection tool, enabling us to study how different incentives and transparency treatments, as well as demographics, impact people's likelihood to share their data.


See `/instrument` for details about our data collection process.
