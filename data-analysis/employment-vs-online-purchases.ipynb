    "# Employment by category vs online purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at changes in local stores (establishments) vs online purchases, comparing business category (by NAICS code) and product category by states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: \n",
    "There is a negative correlation between change in online purchases for category X and change in employment at establishments of NAICS/category X.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categories of interest to study:\n",
    "Criteria for choosing:\n",
    "- Clear dilineation of categories with alignment between NAICS categories and Amazon categories\n",
    "- Reason to believe online and offline retail are substitutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Books stores\n",
    "    - For 2018-2018: hypothesis validated (p<0.05)\n",
    "- Shoes stores\n",
    "    - For 2018-2018: hypothesis validated (p<0.05)\n",
    "\n",
    "No stat. significant result:\n",
    "- Pet supplies\n",
    "    - there is an overall increase in employment and we expect online and offline retail are complementary\n",
    "    \n",
    "- years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021\n",
    "    \n",
    "Not studying\n",
    "- Paint and wallpaper \n",
    "    - not enough online purchases (most paint purchases in our Amazon data for arts and crafts)\n",
    "- Electronics\n",
    "    - ideas for why this didn't work:\n",
    "    - no clear delineation of category -- included tens of subcategories\n",
    "    - overlaps with other NAICS codes -- office supplies, used electronics, toys and games (video game is a big category)\n",
    "    - while book stores and shoes stores clearly have products that people previously needed to buy in stores and can now buy online, there are more and more NEW types of electronics to buy and therefore there is not as clearly a transfer of where specific items are being purchased."
